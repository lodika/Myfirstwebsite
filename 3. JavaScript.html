            JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web,<br>
            alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. <br>
            All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.<br>
